# Ammonia-Combustion-Model

This script was developed in order to model the process of ammonia combustion and the products composition. Ammonia has the potential to become an energy career used for energy storage. It is important to know the products of Ammonia combustion because of the NOx created in the process. The program generates charts showing the molar fractions of selected elements after combustion for different oxidizer/ammonia ratios.
